\section{Conclusion}
\label{secConclusion}

Contraction Hierarchies is a method that can provide a significant speedup for 
shortest path problem algorithms. However, the method could only be used on 
single-weighted graphs until now, which prevented its application to multi-objective
shortest path problem. 

We introduced an extension of the method, called Multi-weighted Contraction Hierarchies (MCH),
which can successfully be applied to multi-weighted graphs. 
MCH consists of two algorithms: offline graph preprocessing and online query algorithm. 

In this paper, we were able to formally prove the correctness of MCH and to test our 
implementation of the method with respect to both the run time and the number of expanded nodes 
on real-world based benchmarks. We compared the method's performance to baseline alternative 
solution -- Multi-criteria Label Setting (MLS) algorithm.

Our results on 12 benchmark instances from 9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge,
representing bi- and tri-objective shortest path search problems on New York City 
road network demonstrate, that MCH algorithms are faster than MLS by an order of 
magnitude on all benchmark instances with at least 20,000 nodes (the instance size 
varied between 10,000 and 270,000 nodes).
