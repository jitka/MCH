% 5. Formal Results
%  - Here, we state and prove the following formal properties of our proposed solution. 


\section{Formal Results}
\label{secFormalResults}

\begin{lemma}
%[Lemma]
Set of edges found by query is Pareto set of shortest paths.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\subseteq$] 

Let $p_{s,t}$ be arbitrary path from Pareto set $P(s,t)$. 

Suppose that $t$ is node with highest rank in the path $p_{s,t}$, 
then path $p_{s,t}$ should be found by forward search
and together with path $p_{t,t}$, $l(p_{t,t})=0$ 
founded by backward search its represents original path.
If $p_{s,t}$ is the single edge, then forward search founds it.
If $p$ is node with second highest rank, then we denote $v$ the
node with third highest rank. 
By the time when $w$ was contracting, all other nodes had been contracted
and $s,t$ was adjacent to $v$. So the shortcut $(s,t)_j$ was created, and forward search uses it.
If $v \ne s$ is the node with second highest rank on the path,
then the sub-path $p_{s,v}$ is found by the forward search by induction and
then sub-path $p_{v,t}$ is also found by the forward search.

The case when $rank(s)$ is the highest rank on path $p_{s,t}$ is very similar. 

Let $v \ne s \ne t$ be node with highest rank on path $p_{s,t}$. 
Sub-path $p_{s,v} \in P(s,v)$ 
if not than the $p' \in P(s,v)$ which dominates $p_{s,v}$ could be substituted
to $p_{s,t}$ and the resulting paths $p'_{s,t}$ dominates $p_{s,t}$ which contradict
$p \in P(s,t)$.
Similarly, $p_{v,t} \in P(v,t) $. Path $p_{s,v}$ is found by forward search end path
$p_{v,t}$ by backward search.

\item[$\supseteq$] 
Each path found by multi-weighted CH corresponds to the path in the original graph. 

\end{itemize}

% \subsection{Highway dimension}
% 
% % TODO (origin-destinetion) 
% 
% Parameter Highway Dimension was introduced in \cite{abraham2010highway}.
% There are few slightly different definition. 
% We use definition based on (\cite{abraham2016highway}, Lemma 4.3)
% which  use \emph{ Sparse Shortest Path Hitting Set (SPHS)}.
% This definition could be easily transformed for multi-weighted directed
% multi-graphs. We changed definition of ball and multiscale SHPS.
% 
% 
% \begin{definition}
% Given a non-negative vector $r \in \mathbb{R}^+$, let 
% $B_{u,r} = \{v \in V, |P(u, v)| \le r \}$ 
% be the ball of radius $r$ centered at $u$.
% \end{definition}
% 
% \begin{definition}
% Given a set of paths $P$, we say that $H \subseteq V$ is a hitting set for $P$ if every
% path in $P$ contains a vertex in $H$. 
% \end{definition}
% 
% \begin{definition}
% For $r > 0$, an $(h, r)-$SPHS is a hitting set $C \subseteq V$ such that
% $\forall v \in V, |B_{2r} (v) \cap C| \le h$.
% \end{definition}
% 
% \begin{definition}
% Let $D$ be the diameter and $k = \log(\max(D))$ logarithm of value of its biggest coordinates. 
% $D_k = D$, when $D_i$ is vector $(w_0,w_1,\dots)$ then $D_{i-1} = (w_0/2,w_1/2,\dots)$. 
% A \emph{multiscale SPHS} of $(G,w)$ is a collection of sets $C_{D_i}$ for $0 \le i \le k$.
% \end{definition}
% 
% \begin{definition}
% If the highway dimension of $(G,w)$ is h, then there exists a multiscale
% SPHS such that $|C_{\log D}| \le h$ and $|C_i| \le h|C_{i+1}|$ for $0 \le i < \log D$.
% \end{definition}
% %diametr $D \in \mathbb{R+}^d$
% 
% In order to get time and space estimates of MCHp and MCHq we need to count shortcuts in
% the graph. Let $Q_{D_i} = C_{D_i} \setminus \Cup^{k}_{j=i+1}C_{D_j}$.
% 
% \begin{lemma}
% For fixed $v$ and $j$, the number of shortcuts $(v,w)$ with $w\in Q_j$ is at most $h$.
% \end{lemma}
% 
% \begin{theorem}
% \label{shrotcutsNumber}
% If $(G,w)$ has highway dimension h, then preprocessing based on
% multiscale SPHS produces a set of shortcuts $E+$ such that degree of every vertex in
% $G(V, E \cup E+)$ is at most $h + h \log D$ and $|E+| \le nh\log D$.
% \end{theorem}
% 
% The proof is exactly same as in (\cite{abraham2016highway}, Lemma 6.1, Theorem 6.2)
% 
% Time complexity of MCHp 
% 
% Time complexity of MCHq. By theorem \ref{shrotcutsNumber} we know that degree is 
% bounded by $h \log D$. When the MLS Algorithm use Fibonacci heaps  
% 

% During query faze we can use bidirectional search 
% \cite{ma2013using}
% with heuristic. 


% There is an ordering of vertices
% such that CH query with range optimization takes
% O((∆ + h log D)(h log D)) time, and a poly-time computable
% ordering such that the query takes O((∆ +
% h log n log D)(h log n log D)) time.

% Theorem 5.3. Consider the variant of CH with additional
% shortcuts. The total number of shortcut
% edges is bounded by |E∗
% | = O(nh log D) or
% O(nh log n log D) for poly-time preprocessing. The
% query takes O((∆ + h log D)(h log D)) time or O((∆ +
% h log n log D)(h log n log D)) for polynomial-time preprocessing.
