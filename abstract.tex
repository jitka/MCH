% Abstract:
% 
%- Common problem: Multi-objective shortest path problems (MOSP) - a 
%  generalization of SPP from graph theory for multi-weighted graphs 
%- Easier variant, single-objective SPP can be solved 
%  using Contraction Hierarchies (CH)
%- we'll show how to apply CH to MOSP
%- we'll test the Multi-weighted Contraction Hierarchies (MCH) approach
%  on New York City road graph and compare the performance to alternative
%  solutions.
%- finally, we prove some formal properties 

\begin{abstract}
Contraction Hierarchies provides guaranteed speedup on singe-criteria graph
with fixed highway dimension. We bring its advantages to multi-criteria 
road graphs.
