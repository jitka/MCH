Multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSP), as a generalization of the shortest path problem (SPP) for multi-weighted graphs, is a graph theory problem with many practical applications in transport domain, as it allows for automated path planning over large road networks, while optimizing criteria like travel time, distance, price, comfort or compatibility with travellerâ€™s preferences. 
While a method called Contraction Hierarchies is often applied to SPP for a guaranteed speedup, it cannot be used for MOSP, due to its incompatibility with multi-weighted graphs. 
In this paper we address this problem by introducing a modified version of Contraction Hierarchies, bringing the advantages of this method to multi-objective variant of the problem. We define a two-stage algorithm called Multi-weighted Contraction Hierarchies (MCH), prove its correctness and evaluate its implementation on a set of New York City road network benchmark instances.
