\section{Introduction}
\label{secIntroduction}

Multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSP) is a fundamental problem from graph theory with many real world applications. Algorithms solving the problem need to find a Pareto set of shortest paths between two nodes in a multi-weighted directed or undirected graphs or multi-graphs. 

Typical example of real-world application of MOSP is automated planning of paths within the transport network represented as a graph, while optimizing criteria like travel time, distance, price, comfort or compatibility with traveller's preferences. This problem arises from both travel industry and daily life activities. Trip planning applications, such as car navigation systems need efficient algorithms for for multi-criteria problems in very large transport networks~\cite{veneti2016time}.

One of the common methods used to speed up the graph search is called Contraction Hierarchies (CH)~\cite{geisberger2008contraction}. They can be used to find the shortest path more efficiently than  alternative routing approaches and is used in many advanced routing techniques~\cite{delling2009engineering}. 

The problem is that CH is not applicable to multi-weighted graphs and therefore cannot be used for MOSP, even though the method was recently used for a similar problem -- Constrained Shortest Path Problem (CSPP)~\cite{pugliese2013survey,funke2013polynomial}. Similarly to MOSP, CSPP algorithms also search for shortest paths in multi-weighted graphs, but instead of complete Pareto sets, they only return a single path with the best linear combination of the weights.

In this paper, we present an algorithm that successfully applies the idea behind Contraction Hierarchies approach to efficiently solve MOSP. Our algorithm, called Multi-weighted Contraction Hierarchies (MCH), is able to find the whole Pareto set of shortest paths between a pair of nodes in a multi-weighted directed multi-graph. In addition to CH, we also draw inspiration from Multicriteria Label-Setting (MLS) algorithm~\cite{martins1984multicriteria}.

After the introduction of required terminology in Section \ref{secPreliminaries}, we describe our two-stage solution in Section \ref{secAlgorithms} -- MHC actually consists of two algorithms: one for offline graph preprocessing and one for the search queries. In Section \ref{secExperiments}, we describe our experiments on DIMACS New York City road network benchmarks and compare the performance to an alternative approach. Finally, in Section \ref{secFormalResults}, we formally prove our algorithm's correctness.
