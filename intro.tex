\section{Introduction}
\label{secIntroduction}

Multi-objective shortest path problems (MOSP) ask for Pareto set of paths
between two nodes in multi-weighted graph in both directed or undirected graphs. 
We consider directed graphs with possible multiple edges.

The MOSP could be use for routing in real word road networks. 
Objectives of route could be length, time, surface quality, popularity and much more.

%  (problem)
%  - CH has good results (reference), but it was no used for MOSP yet
%   CSH

The easier problem with one weight Shortest Path Problem is well studied problem.
On of algorithms is Contraction Hierarchies (CH) \cite{geisberger2008contraction}.

Constrained Shortest Path Problem (CSPP) is 
\cite{pugliese2013survey} problem very similar to MOSP.
It ask of shortest path in multi-weighted graph, but instead whole
Pareto sets search for single paths whit optimalize a linear combination
of weight. CSPP could only found paths on lover envelope of Pareto set.
Contraction Hierarchies was used for CSPP
 \cite{funke2013polynomial}.

%  (solution)
%  - in this paper, we show how CH can be used for MOSP
%  - [describe the solution] 
We present algorithm which found whole paretoset.
Multicriteria Label-Setting (MLS) algorithm~\cite{martins1984multicriteria} 
is optimal for general graphs.

For vehicle or bicycle routing could be used namoa \todo{citace} which is optimal for direct (no preparation) questions.
\todo[inline]{to je state of the art a u te si nejsem jista jestli jsem si naimplementovala dobre a tak ji nemam ve vysledcich, nevim jestli ji davat tady.} 

There could be improvemenents when we allows preprocessing algorithms. 

% Higway dimension  \cite{abraham2010highway} is parametr which is low on road network whit only on criteria and it could be used for upper bound of time complexity of search algorithms. We generalize highway dimension in orther to found complexity bound also for our problem.

Chapter two present problem definition and MLS algorithm. In chapter
three we present multi-criteria contraction hierarchies.
At chapter four we present our experimental result.
Chapter five contains proof of correctness of algorithm.
